        <p>   I am referred to as James T Salamonsen but my operating name is Jt. I grew up in Seattle for almost the entierty of my life.  I also do not believe
            that I will leave Seattle either, I have not found a place that I like better. For most of my early education I did home school and in high school
              I went to SHoreline Christian.  I did 4 years of college doing Web Application and Design but found that my hobby became my job, which lead me to
            not want to do computers anymore.  I then heavily got immeressed in the tree cutting industry for about 6 years whic made me a lot of money.
            Due to having a bunch of money at a young age, I also got heavily involved in auto mechinc work.  I purchased my third vehcile which is a cobalt blue
            Ford Ranger.  But from cutting all those trees and working on vehicles eventually gave me a herniated disc in my lower back.  Granted it's not as bad as some injuries, the location and
            size of the herniation leaves me with numb/tingly legs and hands.  That is how I got the name O'l Numb Hands.  During that same time of my back being
            injured, my lung collapsed.  The two of them together left me without a job for quite a while.  Now that I have the ability to sit or do stuff with out
            being in too much pain, I got back into computer science.
              I have very strong goals for the near future which end up with me working for Google or Nasa.  I have always been good at fixing things and getting
            making things work so being on the forefront of technology is in my goal set for sure.   I specifially would love to work for an off shoot of Google called
            Boston Dynamic.  The deal with robots and functionality which is right along the lines of my work.
              Over all, with my hands on training and my background in copmuters you can trust that you will see me working with one of the leading tech companies!
